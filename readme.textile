h1. Messing around with Holiday by Moorescloud

Just some beginner level stuff.

h2. /bash

If you're feeling impatient, just run @holiday.sh@ for a set of options including the nice simple "off" ;)

Dependencies: curl. On PC that means you'll need something like Cygwin with the curl module installed.

* The simpler script is @holiday-setlights-with-json-files.sh@ which only does setlights taking its JSON objects from .json files.
* There are more options in @holiday.sh@ - basically mucking around with more options, including sending JSON directly from the script.
