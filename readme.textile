h1. Messing around with Holiday

Just some beginner level stuff messing around with "Holiday by Moorescloud":http://moorescloud.com/index.html#holiday.

h2. /bash

If you're feeling impatient, just run @holiday.sh@ for a set of options including the nice simple "off" ;)

* Edit the @HOLIDAYURL@ variable in the .sh files so they point to your Holiday (IP or hostname)
* Dependencies: curl. On PC that means you'll need something like Cygwin with the curl module installed.
* The simpler script is @holiday-setlights-with-json-files.sh@ which only does setlights taking its JSON objects from .json files.
* There are more options in @holiday.sh@ including sending JSON directly from the script.
