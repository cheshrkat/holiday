h1. Messing around with Holiday

Just some beginner level stuff messing around with "Holiday by Moorescloud":http://moorescloud.com/index.html#holiday. The goal here is just to turn the Holiday on and off, maybe with some extras.

h2. /bash

If you're feeling impatient, just run @holiday.sh@ for a set of options including the nice simple "on" and "off".

Scripts:
* @holiday-setlights-with-json-files.sh@ just does setlights taking its JSON objects from .json files. Very simple, easy starting point.
* @holiday.sh@ has more options including sending JSON directly from the script. Uses setlights and gradient API points.
* @nrl.sh@ adds the critically important maroon and blue options not present in the standard NRL app ;)

Notes:
* Edit the @HOLIDAYURL@ variable in the .sh files so they point to your Holiday (IP or hostname)
* Dependencies: curl. On PC that means you'll need something like Cygwin with the curl module installed.

h2. /node-udp

Uses "nodejs":http://nodejs.org/ and @garthk's "holiday-udp":https://github.com/garthk/holiday-udp library. Super-simple on and off examples.

Usage:
* @npm install@
* @node on.js@
* @node off.js@
* @node holiday.js@ for more options including a runner/comet effect

I did say they were simple ;)

Notes:
* Edit the "holiday" variable in the .js files so they point to your Holiday (IP or hostname).

h2. /python

Usage:
* @python holiday.py on@
* @python holiday.py off@
* @python holiday.py hash 123456@ (where 123456 is any valid colour hash)

Dependencies:
* Python
* "requests":http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install

Notes:
Edit the URL in @requests.put@ to point to your holiday.
